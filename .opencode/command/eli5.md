$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

Explain everything in the simplest possible terms:

- Use short sentences
- Avoid jargon and technical terms
- Use analogies to everyday things (toys, food, games)
- If you must use a technical term, immediately explain it simply

Examples:
- Instead of "API endpoint" say "a door where programs knock to ask for things"
- Instead of "database" say "a big organized filing cabinet for information"
- Instead of "authentication" say "showing your ID to prove who you are"

Always check: "Would a 5-year-old understand this?"
