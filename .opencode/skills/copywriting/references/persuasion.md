## Cialdini's 7 Principles of Influence

From *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion* (Robert Cialdini, 1984, updated 2021).

### 1. Reciprocity

**Principle:** We repay what we receive.

**How it works:** Give value first, and people feel obligated to return the favor.

**Copy applications:**
- Free guides, tools, templates
- Ungated valuable content
- Free trials and samples
- Unexpected bonuses

**Examples:**
- "Download our free 50-page marketing playbook"
- "Here's a tool we built—use it free, forever"
- "We'll audit your site for free. No strings attached."

---

### 2. Commitment & Consistency

**Principle:** We honor what we've said or done.

**How it works:** Small commitments lead to larger ones. Once someone says "yes," they're more likely to say "yes" again.

**Copy applications:**
- Micro-commitments before big asks
- Quiz funnels ("Answer 3 questions...")
- Email opt-ins before purchase
- "Yes ladders" in copy

**Examples:**
- "Do you want to grow your business? [Yes] Great, here's how..."
- "Take our 2-minute quiz to find your perfect plan"
- "Just enter your email to save your progress"

---

### 3. Social Proof

**Principle:** We follow the crowd.

**How it works:** If others are doing it, it must be right. Especially "people like me."

**Copy applications:**
- User counts and milestones
- Testimonials and reviews
- Client logos
- "Most popular" labels
- Real-time activity ("John from NYC just signed up")

**Examples:**
- "Join 50,000+ marketers"
- "Rated 4.9/5 by 2,000+ customers"
- "Trusted by Stripe, Airbnb, and Notion"
- "This week's bestseller"

---

### 4. Authority

**Principle:** We trust experts.

**How it works:** Credentials, expertise, and endorsements build trust.

**Copy applications:**
- Media mentions
- Expert credentials
- Data and research
- Industry awards
- Certifications

**Examples:**
- "Featured in Forbes, TechCrunch, and Wired"
- "Built by ex-Google engineers"
- "Based on research from 10,000 companies"
- "Award-winning customer support"

---

### 5. Liking

**Principle:** We buy from people we like.

**How it works:** Similarity, compliments, and familiarity breed liking.

**Copy applications:**
- Founder stories
- Behind-the-scenes content
- Relatable language
- Humor and personality
- Shared values

**Examples:**
- "We started this in a garage, just like you might be doing now"
- "We're developers who got tired of bad tooling"
- "We believe work shouldn't suck"

---

### 6. Scarcity

**Principle:** We want what's rare.

**How it works:** Limited availability increases perceived value and urgency.

**Copy applications:**
- Limited time offers
- Limited quantity
- Exclusive access
- Waitlists
- Early-bird pricing

**Examples:**
- "Only 3 spots left"
- "Offer ends Friday at midnight"
- "Founding member pricing—never available again"
- "Join 500 people on the waitlist"

---

### 7. Unity

**Principle:** We favor our "tribe."

**How it works:** Shared identity creates belonging and loyalty.

**Copy applications:**
- Insider language
- Community belonging
- Shared identity signals
- "Us vs. them" positioning

**Examples:**
- "For developers, by developers"
- "The newsletter for ambitious founders"
- "Join the movement"
- "Welcome to the family"

## Combining Principles

The most effective copy uses multiple principles together:

### Example: Course Launch

> "Join 5,000+ marketers [Social Proof] who've transformed their results with our system. Built by a team with 50 years combined experience at top agencies [Authority]. Founding member pricing ends Friday [Scarcity]—get the complete course plus our private community [Unity] for 60% off."

### Example: SaaS Trial

> "See why teams at Stripe and Notion trust us [Authority + Social Proof]. Start your free 14-day trial [Reciprocity]—no credit card required. Just answer 3 quick questions to customize your experience [Commitment]."

---

## Ethical Guidelines

These principles are powerful. Use them responsibly:

1. **Only make true claims** — Fake scarcity destroys trust
2. **Deliver on promises** — Reciprocity only works if value is real
3. **Represent real social proof** — Fake testimonials are fraud
4. **Don't manufacture fear** — Legitimate urgency, not manipulation
5. **Build genuine community** — Unity requires authentic belonging
