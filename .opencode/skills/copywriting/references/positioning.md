## Harry Dry's Three Rules

From Marketing Examples. Apply to every line of copy.

### Rule 1: Visualize

**Test:** Can you see it?

| Fail | Pass |
|------|------|
| "Transform your workflow" | "From couch to 5K" |
| "Improve productivity" | "Cut meetings by 50%" |
| "Better communication" | "Reply in 60 seconds, not 60 minutes" |
| "Enhanced performance" | "Load in 0.3 seconds" |

**Technique:** Replace abstract nouns with concrete images.

---

### Rule 2: Falsify

**Test:** Is it provable?

| Fail | Pass |
|------|------|
| "High quality" | "Handstitched in Vermont since 1923" |
| "Fast delivery" | "At your door by 10am tomorrow" |
| "Trusted by many" | "Used by 17 of the Fortune 20" |
| "Experienced team" | "20 years as a postman" |

**Technique:** Replace adjectives with evidence.

---

### Rule 3: Unique

**Test:** Could a competitor say it?

| Fail | Pass |
|------|------|
| "The better solution" | "1000 songs in your pocket" |
| "Best in class" | "The only CRM that updates itself" |
| "Innovative platform" | "Built on a blockchain you can actually use" |
| "Premium quality" | "Aged 21 years in oak barrels" |

**Technique:** Find what only you can claim.

---

### Validation

**3 yeses = ship. Any no = rewrite.**

| Copy | Visualize? | Falsify? | Unique? | Verdict |
|------|------------|----------|---------|---------|
| "Transform your business" | No | No | No | Rewrite |
| "Join 50,000 marketers" | Yes | Yes | No | Rewrite |
| "1000 songs in your pocket" | Yes | Yes | Yes | Ship |

---

## Zoom-In Technique

Move from abstract to concrete by asking "How specifically?"

```
"Improve productivity"
  → What kind?
"Help teams work faster"
  → How specifically?
"Reduce meeting time"
  → By how much?
"Cut meetings by 50%"
  → Proof?
"Average user saves 4 hours/week"
```

Keep zooming until you hit something concrete and provable.

---

## Point, Don't Talk

Replace adjectives with proof.

| Don't Say | Do Say |
|-----------|--------|
| "High quality" | "Handmade in Vermont" |
| "Fast" | "0-60 in 3.1 seconds" |
| "Popular" | "17 of 20 teens choose Apple" |
| "Experienced" | "20 years as a postman" |
| "Secure" | "256-bit encryption, SOC 2 certified" |
| "Easy to use" | "Set up in 3 clicks" |

## StoryBrand Framework (Donald Miller)

The SB7 Framework positions customer as hero, brand as guide.

### The 7 Elements

| # | Element | Role | Question to Answer |
|---|---------|------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Character** | Hero (customer) | What do they want? |
| 2 | **Problem** | The obstacle | What's blocking them? (External, Internal, Philosophical) |
| 3 | **Guide** | Your brand | Why can you help? (Empathy + Authority) |
| 4 | **Plan** | The path | How do they succeed? (3 steps) |
| 5 | **Call to Action** | The ask | What should they do? (Direct + Transitional) |
| 6 | **Failure** | The stakes | What if they don't act? |
| 7 | **Success** | The outcome | What does winning look like? |

### Core Principle

**"If you confuse, you lose."**

Clarity beats cleverness. Every piece of messaging should be instantly understood.

---

### Element Details

#### 1. Character (Hero)

The customer is the hero, not your brand.

**Define:**
- What do they want? (external desire)
- What do they really want? (internal desire)
- Why does it matter? (philosophical stake)

**Example:**
- External: "I want project management software"
- Internal: "I want to feel in control"
- Philosophical: "Teams deserve tools that don't suck"

---

#### 2. Problem

Every story needs a villain. Identify three levels:

| Level | Type | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| External | Tangible problem | "Spreadsheets everywhere" |
| Internal | How it makes them feel | "Overwhelmed and disorganized" |
| Philosophical | Why it's wrong | "Teams shouldn't waste time on admin" |

---

#### 3. Guide

Your brand enters as the guide (think Yoda, not Luke).

**Two qualities:**
- **Empathy:** "We understand your struggle"
- **Authority:** "We've solved this before"

**Don't:** Make yourself the hero.

---

#### 4. Plan

Give a simple 3-step plan.

**Example:**
1. Sign up for free
2. Connect your tools
3. See your dashboard in minutes

**Why 3 steps?** Easy to remember, reduces perceived complexity.

---

#### 5. Call to Action

Two types:

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Direct** | The main ask | "Start free trial" |
| **Transitional** | Softer commitment | "Download the guide" |

Always have both on your page.

---

#### 6. Failure (Stakes)

What's at risk if they don't act?

**Examples:**
- "Continue losing hours to manual reporting"
- "Watch competitors outpace you"
- "Keep missing deadlines"

**Don't:** Be too aggressive. Hint at stakes, don't threaten.

---

#### 7. Success (Transformation)

Paint the "after" picture.

**Before → After:**
- Overwhelmed → In control
- Scattered → Organized
- Reactive → Strategic

---

### StoryBrand One-Liner

**Formula:** `[Problem] + [Solution] + [Result]`

**Template:**
> "Most [customers] struggle with [problem]. We help you [solution]. So you can [result]."

**Example:**
> "Most businesses struggle to explain what they do. We help you clarify your message. So customers actually listen."

---

## Conflict Types in Copy

Every good copy has a "but"—use contrast to create meaning.

| Type | Structure | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Before/After** | Pain → Gain | "Couch → 5K" |
| **Problem/Solution** | Issue → Answer | "Meetings too long → Async video" |
| **Us/Them** | Old way → New way | "Throw money at ads vs. Learn copywriting" |
| **Expectation/Reality** | Belief → Surprise | "Dating app designed to be deleted" |
| **Enemy** | Competitor → Hero | "They don't write songs about Volvos" |

---

## Positioning Canvas

Fill this out for any product or campaign:

```
FOR: [Target customer]
WHO: [Has this problem/need]  
WE ARE: [Category/frame]
THAT: [Key benefit/difference]
UNLIKE: [Competitor/old way]
WE: [Proof point/unique capability]

ONE-LINER: ________________________________
```

### Example

```
FOR: Startup founders
WHO: Struggle to explain what their product does
WE ARE: A messaging framework
THAT: Clarifies your pitch in one session
UNLIKE: Expensive brand agencies
WE: Use a proven 7-part story structure

ONE-LINER: Stop confusing customers. Clarify your message in 60 minutes.
```

## Validation Tests

### T-Shirt Test

Would you print this on a shirt?

- **Yes:** It's clear and memorable
- **No:** Too long, too vague, or too corporate

### One Mississippi Test

Can someone understand it in under 2 seconds?

Read your headline aloud. If you can't finish in one "Mississippi," simplify.

### Competitor Test

Could a competitor sign this ad?

- **Yes:** Not unique enough—rewrite
- **No:** You've found your angle
