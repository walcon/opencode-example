# Copywriting Formulas

Complete reference for all 7 core copywriting frameworks.

---

## 1. AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)

The foundational framework dating back to 1898 (Elias St. Elmo Lewis).

| Stage | Goal | Techniques |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Attention** | Stop the scroll | Bold headlines, questions, shocking stats, pattern interrupts |
| **Interest** | Build curiosity | Benefits, stories, relevant facts, "what's in it for me" |
| **Desire** | Create want | Social proof, transformation stories, FOMO, emotional triggers |
| **Action** | Drive conversion | Clear CTA, urgency, risk reversal, friction removal |

**Best for:** Long-form sales pages, email sequences, video scripts, comprehensive campaigns.

### AIDA Example

**Attention:** "97% of landing pages fail to convert. Here's why yours might be next."

**Interest:** "Most businesses spend thousands on traffic but lose visitors in the first 3 seconds. The problem isn't your offer—it's your message."

**Desire:** "Our clients see 3x conversion rates within 30 days. Join 10,000+ marketers who've transformed their results."

**Action:** "Get your free landing page audit now. No credit card required."

## 2. PAS (Problem → Agitate → Solution)

The negative-first emotional trigger framework. Best for short-form copy.

| Stage | Goal | Techniques |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Problem** | Name the pain | Identify specific frustration the reader experiences |
| **Agitate** | Amplify emotion | Make the pain visceral—consequences, costs, embarrassment |
| **Solution** | Present the cure | Position your offer as the obvious answer |

**Best for:** Short-form copy, ads, email subject lines, landing page heroes.

### PAS Example

**Problem:** "Spending hours on marketing copy that doesn't convert?"

**Agitate:** "Every failed campaign costs you leads, revenue, and credibility. Your competitors are winning customers that should be yours."

**Solution:** "Our AI writes high-converting copy in seconds. Start free today."

## 3. BAB (Before → After → Bridge)

The transformation-focused framework.

| Stage | Goal | Techniques |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Before** | Current state (pain) | Paint the problem world vividly |
| **After** | Future state (gain) | Show the transformed outcome |
| **Bridge** | Your solution | Connect the two with your product/service |

**Best for:** Instagram, visual platforms, product descriptions, testimonial structure.

### BAB Example

**Before:** "You're drowning in spreadsheets, spending weekends catching up on reports, missing family dinners."

**After:** "Imagine automated dashboards that update in real-time. Weekends free. Data at your fingertips."

**Bridge:** "DataFlow connects your tools and builds reports automatically. Set it up once, check it whenever."

## 4. FAB (Features → Advantages → Benefits)

The product-to-customer translator.

| Stage | Goal | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Features** | What it has | "5GB storage" |
| **Advantages** | Why it matters | "Stores more than any competitor" |
| **Benefits** | What you get | "1000 songs in your pocket" |

**Best for:** Product pages, spec sheets, feature announcements.

**Key principle:** Always end on the benefit. Features tell, benefits sell.

### FAB Example

| Feature | Advantage | Benefit |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| 24/7 support | Always available | Never stuck waiting for help |
| 256-bit encryption | Bank-level security | Your data stays private |
| 1-click export | No complex menus | Save hours every week |

## 5. 4Ps (Promise → Picture → Proof → Push)

Extended persuasion sequence for sales-heavy content.

| Stage | Goal | Techniques |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Promise** | Hook with outcome | Lead with the transformation |
| **Picture** | Visualize success | Paint vivid future state |
| **Proof** | Build credibility | Stats, testimonials, case studies |
| **Push** | Call to action | Create urgency, remove friction |

**Best for:** Sales pages, webinar scripts, infomercials.

### 4Ps Example

**Promise:** "Double your email open rates in 14 days."

**Picture:** "Imagine checking your stats and seeing 40%, 50%, even 60% open rates. Your list actually reads what you send."

**Proof:** "We've helped 2,000+ creators hit these numbers. Sarah went from 12% to 47% in just 10 days."

**Push:** "Start your free trial now. Cancel anytime. First 100 users get lifetime pricing."

## 6. SCQA (Situation → Complication → Question → Answer)

The consultant's framework (McKinsey origins). Best for B2B.

| Stage | Goal | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Situation** | Establish context | "Most teams use 5+ tools for marketing" |
| **Complication** | Introduce problem | "But integration failures lose 20% of data" |
| **Question** | Frame the inquiry | "How do you unify your stack?" |
| **Answer** | Present solution | "One platform that does it all" |

**Best for:** LinkedIn, B2B content, presentations, executive summaries.

### SCQA Example

**Situation:** "Enterprise teams manage thousands of customer touchpoints across email, chat, phone, and social."

**Complication:** "But siloed data means reps don't know a customer just complained on Twitter before answering their call."

**Question:** "How do you give every rep a complete customer view?"

**Answer:** "UnifiedCX syncs all channels in real-time. One inbox, one customer record, zero context switching."

## 7. The 4Cs (Clear → Concise → Compelling → Credible)

Quality checklist, not a sequence. Apply to any copy.

| Element | Test Question |
|---------|---------------|
| **Clear** | Can a 12-year-old understand it? |
| **Concise** | Can any word be cut? |
| **Compelling** | Does it make you want to act? |
| **Credible** | Can you prove every claim? |

### 4Cs Validation

Run every piece of copy through these questions:

1. **Clear:** Read it aloud. Any stumbles = rewrite.
2. **Concise:** Delete every "that," "very," "really." Still work? Keep them deleted.
3. **Compelling:** Would YOU click/buy/sign up? Be honest.
4. **Credible:** Circle every claim. Can you link to proof for each?

## Formula Selection Guide

| Scenario | Recommended Formula |
|----------|---------------------|
| Short ad, cold audience | PAS |
| Long sales page | AIDA or 4Ps |
| Product feature announcement | FAB |
| Social media post | BAB |
| B2B/LinkedIn | SCQA |
| Brand positioning | StoryBrand + Three Rules |
| Headline testing | 4U's |

---

## Awareness → Formula Matching

| Awareness Level | Best Formulas |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Unaware | Story-led, PAS (soft problem) |
| Problem-Aware | PAS, BAB |
| Solution-Aware | FAB, 4Ps |
| Product-Aware | AIDA, FAB with comparisons |
| Most Aware | Direct CTA, offer-focused |

**Key insight:** Copy length increases as awareness decreases.

- **Most Aware:** Needs a button
- **Unaware:** Needs education

## Combining Formulas

Formulas aren't mutually exclusive. Common combinations:

| Primary | Secondary | Use Case |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| AIDA | PAS | Use PAS for the Attention hook |
| 4Ps | FAB | Use FAB within the Picture section |
| BAB | PAS | Use PAS to paint the Before |
| SCQA | FAB | Use FAB within the Answer |

The 4Cs checklist applies to ALL copy regardless of formula.
