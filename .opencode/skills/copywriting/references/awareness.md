## The 5 Stages of Awareness

| Stage | Customer State | What They Know |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| **1. Unaware** | Doesn't know they have a problem | Nothing—they're not looking |
| **2. Problem-Aware** | Knows the pain | The problem exists, but not that solutions exist |
| **3. Solution-Aware** | Knows solutions exist | Solutions are out there, but not your specific product |
| **4. Product-Aware** | Knows your product | Your product exists, but needs convincing to buy |
| **5. Most Aware** | Ready to buy | Your product, the benefits, just needs the right offer |

## Headline Strategies by Stage

### 1. Unaware

**Goal:** Lead with emotion or identity, not product.

**Strategy:** 
- Start with their world, not yours
- Use identity-based hooks
- Tell stories they see themselves in

**Examples:**
- "Are you tired of feeling invisible in meetings?"
- "What successful founders do differently"
- "The hidden cost of playing it safe"

**Don't:** Mention your product, solution, or category.

---

### 2. Problem-Aware

**Goal:** Agitate the problem, hint at solution.

**Strategy:**
- Name their pain specifically
- Show you understand deeply
- Tease that a solution exists

**Examples:**
- "Why your best ideas never get heard"
- "The real reason your campaigns keep failing"
- "What nobody tells you about scaling a team"

**Don't:** Jump straight to your solution.

---

### 3. Solution-Aware

**Goal:** Differentiate your approach.

**Strategy:**
- Acknowledge existing solutions
- Position against alternatives
- Highlight your unique mechanism

**Examples:**
- "3 communication frameworks executives use"
- "Why meditation apps don't work (and what does)"
- "The project management approach agencies are switching to"

**Don't:** Assume they know why you're different.

---

### 4. Product-Aware

**Goal:** Features, benefits, comparisons.

**Strategy:**
- Deep-dive on capabilities
- Compare directly to alternatives
- Address specific objections

**Examples:**
- "How SpeakUp Pro helps you command any room"
- "Notion vs. Coda vs. Slite: The complete comparison"
- "What 10,000 hours of customer feedback taught us"

**Don't:** Be vague—they want specifics.

---

### 5. Most Aware

**Goal:** Price, offer, urgency.

**Strategy:**
- Lead with the deal
- Remove final friction
- Create urgency

**Examples:**
- "SpeakUp Pro—50% off this week only"
- "Free trial. No credit card. Cancel anytime."
- "Join before Friday and get the bonus course"

**Don't:** Over-explain—they already know.

## Copy Length by Awareness

**Key insight:** Copy length increases as awareness decreases.

| Awareness | Copy Length | Reason |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Most Aware | Short | Just needs CTA |
| Product-Aware | Medium | Needs proof and comparison |
| Solution-Aware | Medium-Long | Needs differentiation |
| Problem-Aware | Long | Needs problem/solution education |
| Unaware | Very Long | Needs complete journey |

---

## Determining Awareness Level

Ask these questions about your audience:

### Traffic Source Analysis

| Source | Likely Awareness |
|--------|------------------|
| Brand search ("Nike shoes") | Most Aware |
| Product search ("running shoes review") | Product-Aware |
| Solution search ("how to run faster") | Solution-Aware |
| Problem search ("knee pain when running") | Problem-Aware |
| Social scroll / Display ads | Unaware |

### Audience Signals

| Signal | Likely Awareness |
|--------|------------------|
| Visited pricing page | Most Aware |
| Downloaded comparison guide | Product-Aware |
| Read "how to" blog posts | Solution-Aware |
| Searched symptoms/pain points | Problem-Aware |
| Cold list / Lookalike audience | Unaware |

---

## Framework Matching

| Awareness Level | Best Formulas | Copy Length |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Unaware | Story-led, soft PAS | Long |
| Problem-Aware | PAS, BAB | Medium-Long |
| Solution-Aware | FAB, 4Ps | Medium |
| Product-Aware | AIDA, FAB + comparisons | Medium |
| Most Aware | Direct CTA, offer-focused | Short |

---

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Product-focused to Unaware audience

**Wrong:** "Try our AI-powered project management tool"
**Right:** "Why your best work happens after everyone leaves"

### Mistake 2: Education to Most Aware audience

**Wrong:** Long explanation of benefits they already know
**Right:** "Black Friday: 50% off annual plans"

### Mistake 3: One-size-fits-all

**Wrong:** Same landing page for all traffic sources
**Right:** Different pages for search vs. social vs. email

## Practical Application

1. **Identify your traffic source** → Estimate awareness level
2. **Match headline strategy** → Use appropriate approach
3. **Calibrate copy length** → Longer for less aware
4. **Select formula** → PAS for problem-aware, AIDA for product-aware, etc.
5. **Test and iterate** → Your audience may differ from assumptions
