## 1. Core Copywriting Formulas

### 1.1 AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)

The foundational framework dating back to 1898 (Elias St. Elmo Lewis).

| Stage | Goal | Techniques |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Attention** | Stop the scroll | Bold headlines, questions, shocking stats, pattern interrupts |
| **Interest** | Build curiosity | Benefits, stories, relevant facts, "what's in it for me" |
| **Desire** | Create want | Social proof, transformation stories, FOMO, emotional triggers |
| **Action** | Drive conversion | Clear CTA, urgency, risk reversal, friction removal |

**Best for:** Long-form sales pages, email sequences, video scripts, comprehensive campaigns.

---

### 1.2 PAS (Problem → Agitate → Solution)

The negative-first emotional trigger framework.

| Stage | Goal | Techniques |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Problem** | Name the pain | Identify specific frustration the reader experiences |
| **Agitate** | Amplify emotion | Make the pain visceral—consequences, costs, embarrassment |
| **Solution** | Present the cure | Position your offer as the obvious answer |

**Best for:** Short-form copy, ads, email subject lines, landing page heroes.

**Example:**
- Problem: "Spending hours on marketing copy that doesn't convert?"
- Agitate: "Every failed campaign costs you leads, revenue, and credibility."
- Solution: "Our AI writes high-converting copy in seconds."

---

### 1.3 BAB (Before → After → Bridge)

The transformation-focused framework.

| Stage | Goal | Techniques |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Before** | Current state (pain) | Paint the problem world vividly |
| **After** | Future state (gain) | Show the transformed outcome |
| **Bridge** | Your solution | Connect the two with your product/service |

**Best for:** Instagram, visual platforms, product descriptions, testimonial structure.

---

### 1.4 FAB (Features → Advantages → Benefits)

The product-to-customer translator.

| Stage | Goal | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Features** | What it has | "5GB storage" |
| **Advantages** | Why it matters | "Stores more than any competitor" |
| **Benefits** | What you get | "1000 songs in your pocket" |

**Best for:** Product pages, spec sheets, feature announcements.

**Key principle:** Always end on the benefit. Features tell, benefits sell.

---

### 1.5 4Ps (Promise → Picture → Proof → Push)

Extended persuasion sequence.

| Stage | Goal | Techniques |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Promise** | Hook with outcome | Lead with the transformation |
| **Picture** | Visualize success | Paint vivid future state |
| **Proof** | Build credibility | Stats, testimonials, case studies |
| **Push** | Call to action | Create urgency, remove friction |

**Best for:** Sales pages, webinar scripts, infomercials.

---

### 1.6 SCQA (Situation → Complication → Question → Answer)

The consultant's framework (McKinsey origins).

| Stage | Goal | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Situation** | Establish context | "Most teams use 5+ tools for marketing" |
| **Complication** | Introduce problem | "But integration failures lose 20% of data" |
| **Question** | Frame the inquiry | "How do you unify your stack?" |
| **Answer** | Present solution | "One platform that does it all" |

**Best for:** LinkedIn, B2B content, presentations, executive summaries.

---

### 1.7 The 4 Cs (Clear → Concise → Compelling → Credible)

Quality checklist, not a sequence.

| Element | Test Question |
|---------|---------------|
| **Clear** | Can a 12-year-old understand it? |
| **Concise** | Can any word be cut? |
| **Compelling** | Does it make you want to act? |
| **Credible** | Can you prove every claim? |

---

## 2. Customer Awareness Framework

### Eugene Schwartz's 5 Stages of Awareness

From *Breakthrough Advertising* (1966)—still the gold standard.

| Stage | Customer State | Headline Strategy |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Unaware** | Doesn't know they have a problem | Lead with emotion/identity, not product |
| **Problem-Aware** | Knows the pain, not the solution | Agitate the problem, hint at solution |
| **Solution-Aware** | Knows solutions exist, not yours | Differentiate your approach |
| **Product-Aware** | Knows your product, needs convincing | Features, benefits, comparisons |
| **Most Aware** | Ready to buy, needs a nudge | Price, offer, urgency, guarantee |

**Key insight:** Copy length increases as awareness decreases. Most-aware needs a button. Unaware needs education.

### Headline Strategies by Awareness Level

```
Unaware:      "Are you tired of feeling invisible in meetings?"
Problem:      "Why your best ideas never get heard"
Solution:     "3 communication frameworks executives use"
Product:      "How SpeakUp Pro helps you command any room"
Most Aware:   "SpeakUp Pro—50% off this week only"
```

## 3. Persuasion Psychology

### 3.1 Cialdini's 7 Principles of Influence

From *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion* (1984, updated 2021).

| Principle | Definition | Marketing Application |
|-----------|------------|----------------------|
| **Reciprocity** | We repay what we receive | Free value first (guides, tools, samples) |
| **Commitment** | We honor what we've said | Micro-commitments, quizzes, email opt-ins |
| **Social Proof** | We follow the crowd | Testimonials, user counts, reviews |
| **Authority** | We trust experts | Credentials, media mentions, certifications |
| **Liking** | We buy from people we like | Personality, storytelling, relatability |
| **Scarcity** | We want what's rare | Limited time/quantity, exclusivity |
| **Unity** | We favor our "tribe" | Shared identity, insider language, community |

### Application Matrix

| Principle | Copy Element |
|-----------|-------------|
| Reciprocity | Lead magnets, free tools, ungated content |
| Commitment | "Yes" ladders, quiz funnels, micro-CTAs |
| Social Proof | "Join 50,000+ marketers", testimonials, logos |
| Authority | "Featured in Forbes", certifications, data |
| Liking | Founder stories, behind-the-scenes, humor |
| Scarcity | Countdown timers, "only 3 left", waitlists |
| Unity | "For developers, by developers", community |

---

### 3.2 Emotional Triggers

Core emotions that drive action:

| Emotion | Trigger Phrases |
|---------|----------------|
| **Fear** | "Don't miss out", "What if you're wrong?", "Protect yourself" |
| **Greed** | "Double your income", "Exclusive access", "Unfair advantage" |
| **Guilt** | "You deserve better", "Stop settling", "Owe it to yourself" |
| **Pride** | "Be the expert", "Impress your boss", "Stand out" |
| **Belonging** | "Join the movement", "You're one of us", "Be part of" |

---

## 4. Messaging & Positioning

### 4.1 Harry Dry's Three Rules

From Marketing Examples—apply to every line of copy.

| Rule | Test | Fail → Pass |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Visualize** | Can you see it? | "Transform your workflow" → "From couch to 5K" |
| **Falsify** | Is it provable? | "High quality" → "Handstitched in Vermont since 1923" |
| **Unique** | Could a competitor say it? | "The better solution" → "1000 songs in your pocket" |

**Validation:** 3 yeses = ship. Any no = rewrite.

### Zoom-In Technique (Abstract → Concrete)

```
"Improve productivity"
  → What kind?
"Help teams work faster"
  → How specifically?
"Reduce meeting time"
  → By how much?
"Cut meetings by 50%"
  → Proof?
"Average user saves 4 hours/week"
```

### Point, Don't Talk (Replace adjectives with proof)

| Don't Say | Do Say |
|-----------|--------|
| "High quality" | "Handmade in Vermont" |
| "Fast" | "0-60 in 3.1 seconds" |
| "Popular" | "17 of 20 teens choose Apple" |
| "Experienced" | "20 years as a postman" |

---

### 4.2 StoryBrand Framework (Donald Miller)

The SB7 Framework—position customer as hero, brand as guide.

| Element | Role | Question to Answer |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| **1. Character** | Hero (customer) | What do they want? |
| **2. Problem** | External, Internal, Philosophical | What's blocking them? |
| **3. Guide** | Your brand | Why can you help? (Empathy + Authority) |
| **4. Plan** | 3-step process | How do they succeed? |
| **5. Call to Action** | Direct + Transitional | What should they do? |
| **6. Failure** | Stakes | What if they don't act? |
| **7. Success** | Transformation | What does winning look like? |

**Core principle:** "If you confuse, you lose."

### StoryBrand One-Liner Formula

```
[Problem] + [Solution] + [Result]

"Most businesses struggle to explain what they do. We help you clarify 
your message. So customers actually listen."
```

---

### 4.3 Conflict Types in Copy

Every good copy has a "but"—use contrast to create meaning.

| Type | Structure | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Before/After** | Pain state → Gain state | "Couch → 5K" |
| **Problem/Solution** | Issue → Answer | "Meetings too long → Async video" |
| **Us/Them** | Old way → New way | "Throw money at ads vs. Learn copywriting" |
| **Expectation/Reality** | Common belief → Surprise | "Dating app designed to be deleted" |
| **Enemy** | Competitor/category → Hero | "They don't write songs about Volvos" |

---

### 4.4 Positioning Canvas

Fill this out for any product/campaign:

```
FOR: [Target customer]
WHO: [Has this problem/need]
WE ARE: [Category/frame]
THAT: [Key benefit/difference]
UNLIKE: [Competitor/old way]
WE: [Proof point/unique capability]

ONE-LINER: ________________________________
```

**Tests:**
- T-shirt test: Would you print this on a shirt?
- One Mississippi: Understood in under 2 seconds?
- Competitor test: Could they sign this ad?

---

## 5. Quality Validation

### 5.1 The 4U's Headline Formula

Developed by Michael Masterson (AWAI).

| Element | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Useful** | Shows benefit | "How to write headlines that convert" |
| **Urgent** | Creates time pressure | "Before your next launch" |
| **Unique** | Differentiates | "The counterintuitive approach" |
| **Ultra-specific** | Provides details | "7 formulas with 23 examples" |

**Scoring:** Rate 1-4 for each. Target: 3.5+ average.

---

### 5.2 Copy Review Checklist

Before shipping any copy:

```
□ One Mississippi test (understood in <2 seconds?)
□ Every line visualizable (concrete, not abstract?)
□ Every claim falsifiable (provable, not adjective soup?)
□ Competitor couldn't sign it (unique angle?)
□ Kaplan's Law applied (every word earns its place?)
□ No paragraph >2 lines
□ First line hooks to second (curiosity → payoff)
□ Reviewed in context (mocked up where it lives)
□ Word count reduced: Started ___ → Ended ___
```

### Red Flag Words (Automatic rewrite needed)

| Red Flag | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| "Innovative solution" | Abstract, unfalsifiable |
| "Best in class" | Generic, competitor could say it |
| "Seamless experience" | Can't visualize |
| "Transform your..." | Abstract verb |
| "Cutting-edge" | Meaningless buzzword |
| Multiple adjectives | Hiding weak nouns |
| "And" 3+ times | Scope creep |

### Agent Prompting Pattern

Each agent should receive:

1. **Context:** Brief, product details, audience, channel
2. **Framework:** Which formula(s) to apply
3. **Constraints:** Length, tone, forbidden words
4. **Examples:** Swipe file references for calibration
5. **Output format:** Structure for deliverable
